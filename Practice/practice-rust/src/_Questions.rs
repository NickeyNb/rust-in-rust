// Certainly! Let's break it down into five questions for each category:

// a). Variables and Data Types:
// 1- Take user input
// 2- Take two inputs and print their sum
// 3- Declare variables for an integer, a floating-point number, a boolean, a character, and a string. Print the values.
// 4- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations on two numeric variables.
// 5- Declare and initialize variables for a person's name, age, and height. Print these values.
// 6- Create a boolean variable that represents whether it's sunny today. Print a message based on the value.

// b). Control Flow:
// Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero and prints the result.
// Implement a simple rock-paper-scissors game where the user can input their choice.
// Create a program that determines if a given year is a leap year or not.
// Write a function that checks if a given character is a vowel or a consonant.
// Implement a basic calculator program that takes two numbers and an operator as input.

// 3. Functions:
// Create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
// Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.
// Implement a function that checks if a number is prime.
// Create a function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
// Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.

// 4. Ownership and Borrowing (Basic Level):
// Define a function that takes ownership of a vector and prints its elements.
// Modify the function to borrow the vector instead of taking ownership.
// Create a function that takes a string slice and appends another string to it.
// Write a program that demonstrates the ownership transfer between variables.
// Implement a function that returns the length of the longest word in a vector of strings.

// 5. Arrays and Slices:
// Declare an array of integers and print each element using a for loop.
// Find the sum of all elements in an array.
// Create a slice from an array, modify the slice, and print both the array and the slice.
// Write a program that searches for a specific element in an array and prints its index.
// Implement a function that takes a slice and returns the reversed slice.

// 6. Loops and Iterators:
// Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
// Use a loop to iterate over a range of numbers and print whether each number is even or odd.
// Implement a simple countdown timer using a loop.
// Write a program that generates and prints a random number between 1 and 100.
// Use a loop to print the multiplication table for a given number.

// 7. Error Handling:
// Implement a function that divides two numbers, handling the case of division by zero with a custom error message.
// Use the Result type to handle errors in a function that converts a string to an integer.
// Write a function that returns a Result indicating success or failure based on a condition.
// Create a program that reads a file and handles the possible errors (file not found, permission issues, etc.).
// Implement a function that parses a date string and returns a Result with the parsed date.

// 8. Structs and Enums (Basic Level):
// Create a struct representing a book with properties like title, author, and page count.
// Define an enum for different types of shapes (circle, square, triangle) and associate it with a struct containing relevant properties.
// Write a program that uses a struct to represent a point in 3D space.
// Implement a function that calculates the area of different shapes using a struct and enum.
// Create a simple inventory system using structs and enums.

// 9. Pattern Matching:
// Write a function that takes a tuple representing coordinates (x, y) and prints the quadrant the point is in.
// Use pattern matching to distinguish between weekdays and weekends.
// Implement a function that checks if a given value is an Option and prints whether it's Some or None.
// Write a program that matches different types of vehicles and prints their fuel efficiency.
// Create a function that pattern matches on a Result and prints a success message or an error message.

// 10. Strings and String Manipulation (Basic Level):
// Concatenate two strings and print the result.
// Find the length of a string and print it.
// Write a program that reads a sentence from the user, counts the number of words, and prints the result.
// Implement a function that checks if a string contains a specific substring.
// Use string interpolation to create a message that includes variables.
